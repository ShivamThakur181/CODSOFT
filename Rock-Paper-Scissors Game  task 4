1 User Input: Prompt the user to choose rock, paper, or scissors.
Computer Selection: Generate a random choice (rock, paper, or scissors) for
the computer.

2 Game Logic: Determine the winner based on the user's choice and the
computer's choice.

Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
3 Display Result: Show the user's choice and the computer's choice.
Display the result, whether the user wins, loses, or it's a tie.

4 Score Tracking (Optional): Keep track of the user's and computer's scores for
multiple rounds.

5 Play Again: Ask the user if they want to play another round.

6 User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and
feedback.
